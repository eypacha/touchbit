# Touchbit

Touchbit is an interactive web application for exploring, editing, and visualizing musical expressions generated by ByteBeat-style algorithms. It allows users to experiment with audio synthesis, visualize waveforms, and easily share their creations.

**Touchbit is fully optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and responsive experience on smartphones and tablets as well as desktop.**

## Main Features

- **ByteBeat Expression Editor**: Modify and test mathematical formulas to generate algorithmic music in real time.
- **Audio Visualizers**: Graphically display the waveform and spectrum of generated expressions.
- **Preset Management and Saving**: Save, load, and share your favorite expressions.
- **Modern, Responsive Interface**: Built with Vue 3, Vite, and TailwindCSS, optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Panels**: Tools for editing parameters, visualizing results, and navigating between different usage modes.
- **Collaboration and Streaming Support**: Share sessions and view creations in real time.

## Who is Touchbit for?

Touchbit is designed for musicians, programmers, digital audio enthusiasts, and anyone interested in algorithmic synthesis and sound experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management
- [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) for markdown editing
- [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) for real-time collaboration

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to start exploring Touchbit.

## Testing and Development

Includes unit tests (Vitest) and end-to-end tests (Cypress). See the scripts in `package.json` for more details.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
yarn test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
yarn build
yarn test:e2e
```
